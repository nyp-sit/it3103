# Week 1 Practical 

## Tensorflow Playground 

We will use an online neural network interactive tool to construct a neural network to perform simple binary classification and to consolidate some of the concepts we learnt from the lecture and see how activation function, learning rate, and the capacity (width and depth) affects the ability of the neural network to learn.

### Task 1

Use <img heigth=25 width=25 src="images/dataset1.png"/> as data set

Choose X1 and X2 as input features and choose Linear activation function. Use a single neuron (in a single layer). 
- Can the network classify the data points? 


### Task 2 

Use <img heigth=25 width=25 src="images/dataset2.png"/> as data set

Choose X1 and X2 as input features and choose Linear activation function. Use a single neuron (in a single layer). 
- Can the network classify the data points? 
- Increase the neurons in a single layer. What happens? 
- Increase the number of layers. What happens?

Now choose RELU as activation function. Use a single neuron (in a single layer). 

- Can the network classify the data points? 
- Try to restart the network training, what do you observe? 
- Try increasing number of neurons in a single layer, what do you observe? 
- Try increasing the number of layers, what do you observe? 

### Task 3

Use <img heigth=25 width=25 src="images/dataset3.png"/> as data set

Choose X1 and X2 asinput features. Choose RELU activation function. Try with different number of neurons and with different number of layers
- What do you observe? 

Choose different combinations of features (e.g. X1X2, $X1^2, sin(X1), etc), and re-run the network. 
- What do you observe?
